Short Weierstrass curves
An elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form [database entry; Sage verification script; Sage output] has parameters a b and coordinates x y satisfying the following equations:

  y2=x3+a*x+b

Affine addition formulas: (x1,y1)+(x2,y2)=(x3,y3) where

  x3 = (y2-y1)2/(x2-x1)2-x1-x2
  y3 = (2*x1+x2)*(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)-(y2-y1)3/(x2-x1)3-y1

Affine doubling formulas: 2(x1,y1)=(x3,y3) where

  x3 = (3*x12+a)2/(2*y1)2-x1-x1
  y3 = (2*x1+x1)*(3*x12+a)/(2*y1)-(3*x12+a)3/(2*y1)3-y1

Affine negation formulas: -(x1,y1)=(x1,-y1).

The neutral element of the curve is the unique point at infinity, namely (0:1:0) in projective coordinates.
